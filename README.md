I'm Kaio, a _stack-agnostic\*_ software engineer with almost a decade of experience in the software industry, spanning multiple tech stacks, several industry verticals and all organization sizes.

## üëãüèΩ About me

I'm Brazilian, from S√£o Paulo, where I developed a solid foundational set of engineering skills in my first five years in the industry, benefiting from the strong IT market in the region. Nowadays I live in Lisbon, Portugal, where I started my international career about four years ago. Here, I had the opportunity to work remotely for some UK companies such as FindMyPast, which focuses on helping customers connect to their family stories, where I helped improve retention and engagement via [A/B/n testing](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/ab-testing-web-app) and developing lean product features; and The Trainline, the leading Train ticketing company in Europe, where I helped supporting existing carrier connections and implemented a cache-based, redis-powered solution to keep track of ticket availability for one of the carriers. This year I joined Bloqit, the fastest-growing smart locker company in the world and one of the top 10 most promising startups in Portugal, focused on developing end-to-end, fully integrated, state-of-the-art smart-locker solutions, where I've been helping to sustain their accelerated growth pace, while also architecting new ideas and solutions, with a special eye out for scalability and testability.

I've been using GitHub both professionally and as my portfolio. As a result of this fact, the contribution stats shown here are a comprehensive summary of all my engineering efforts on these two fronts. My public repositories approach a wide range of engineering topics, all implemented with clean code that works and solid documentation and references. So make sure to take a look at the Pinned section below!
