### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer with 6+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career I've worked mostly for consultancy firms, which allowed me to get in touch with a lot of different domains and to learn a lot of interesting stacks.

I'm Brazilian, from São Paulo, but I'm currently based on Lisbon, Portugal, where I'm working remotely for FindMyPast, a company that helps professionals and enthusiasts of geneology to build family trees. The biggest challenges thera are the volume of data we have to handle (billions of family tree records, hints and search data).

My previous experiences includes Trainline, the leading train ticketing company in Europe, and Yellowcam, a small startup based in São Paulo.

I'm currently studying design patterns, because althought I'm familiar with most part of the patterns described in the book, I would like to get deeper knowledge behind each of them. I'm enjoying the book, so I decided to document my learnings in a catalog. If you're curious about it, please have a look at [design-patterns](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/design-patterns).

I'm also interested on building highly scalable and production-ready NodeJS applications, so you'll probably find some experimental repositories with interesting examples on the "Pinned" section below.
