### Hello there 👋🏽

I'm Kaio (he/his), a software engineer with 7+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I've worked mostly for consultancy firms, which allowed me to get in touch with different domains and learn interesting stacks.

I'm Brazilian, from São Paulo, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal, where I've started my international career about three years ago. So far, I've worked for two UK-based companies: FindMyPast, where I helped to evolve their product via [A/B/n experimentation](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/ab-testing-web-app) and developing lean software, and Trainline, where I helped supporting existing carrier connections and implemented a cache-based solution to keep track of ticket availability for one of the carriers. This year, though, I've changed gears and joined Bloqit, a Portuguese company focused on revolutionizing delivery via smart lockers.

I take learning seriously and always try to document my progress in the form of repositories here in GitHub. Some of these repos demand a lot of effort to build and maintain, so I think they deserve a special spot in the "Pinned" section below. Make sure to check them out if you have some time! 😀
