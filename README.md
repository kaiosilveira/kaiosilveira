I'm a stack-agnostic* software engineer with 8+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I've worked mostly for consultancy firms, which allowed me to get in touch with different domains and learn a multitude of stacks.

I'm Brazilian, from S√£o Paulo, where I developed a solid foundational set of engineering skills in my first five years in the industry, benefiting from the strong IT market in the region. Nowadays, I'm living in Lisbon, Portugal, where I started my international career about three years ago. Here, I've been almost exclusively working remotely and had contributed to companies such as FindMyPast, a company focused on helping customers connect to their family stories, where I helped improve retention and engagement via [A/B/n experimentation](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/ab-testing-web-app) and developing lean product features; and The Trainline, the leading Train ticketing company in Europe, where I helped supporting existing carrier connections and implemented a cache-based, redis-powered solution to keep track of ticket availability for one of the carriers. This year I joined Bloqit, a Portuguese company focused on developing end-to-end, fully integrated, state-of-the-art smart locker solutions.

I've been using GitHub both professionally and as my portfolio, so here you'll find repositories approaching a wide range of engineering topics, all implemented with clean code that works and solid documentation. Make sure to take a look at the Pinned section below!
