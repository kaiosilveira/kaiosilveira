## Salve, quebrada ‚úäüèΩ (Hello there!)

I'm Kaio, a software engineer with 8+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I've worked mostly for consultancy firms, which allowed me to get in touch with different domains and learn a multitude of stacks.

I'm Brazilian, from S√£o Paulo, where I've developed solid engineering skills in my first five years of industry, benefiting from the strong IT market in the region. Now I'm based in Lisbon, Portugal, where I started my international career about three years ago. So far, I've worked for two UK-based companies: FindMyPast, a company focused on helping customers connecting to their family stories, where I helped improving retention and engagement via [A/B/n experimentation](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/ab-testing-web-app) and developing lean product features; and the Trainline, the leading Train ticketing company in Europe, where I helped supporting existing carrier connections and implemented a cache-based, redis-powered solution to keep track of ticket availability for one of the carriers. This year, though, I've changed gears and joined Bloqit, a Portuguese company focused on developing end-to-end smart locker solutions.

I've been using GitHub as my main portifolio, so here you'll find repositories approaching a wide breadth of engineering topics, all with working implementations and solid documentation. Make sure to take a look at the Pinned section below!
