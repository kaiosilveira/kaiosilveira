### Hello there üëãüèΩ

I'm Kaio (he/him), a software engineer with 7+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career I've worked mostly for consultancy firms, which allowed me to get in touch with a lot of different domains and to learn a lot of interesting stacks.

I'm Brazilian, from S√£o Paulo, but I'm currently based in Lisbon, Portugal, where I'm working remotely for FindMyPast, a company that helps professionals and enthusiasts of genealogy to build family trees. The biggest challenges there are the volume of data we have to handle (billions of family tree records, hints and search data), which we manage to overcome with a service-oriented architecture built mostly with NodeJS and GraphQL, all running on k8s. I'm currently in a product-facing team which has as the main goals improve some business metrics, which we are managing to accomplish by developing a data-driven mindset and launching A/B experiments to support our assumptions in a regular basis.

My other recent working experiences include the Trainline, the leading train ticketing company in Europe, and Yellowcam, a startup based in S√£o Paulo which provides monitoring features to urban areas.

I take learning seriously and always try to document my progress in the form of repositories here in GitHub. Some of these repos demands a lot of effort to build, so I think they deserve a special spot in the "pinned" section below. Make sure to check them out if you have some time! üòÄ
