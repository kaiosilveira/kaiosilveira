# Salve, quebrada! ‚úäüèΩüáßüá∑

I'm Kaio, a _stack-agnostic\*_ software engineer with almost a decade of experience in the software industry, spanning multiple tech stacks, several industry verticals and all organization sizes.

## üëãüèΩ About me

I'm Brazilian, from S√£o Paulo, where I developed a solid foundational set of engineering skills in my first five years in the industry, benefiting from the strong IT market in the region. Nowadays I live in Lisbon, Portugal, where I'm helping to build the future of smart-lockers at Bloqit, the fastest-growing smart locker company in the world and one of the top 10 most promising scale-ups in Portugal, where I help develop end-to-end, fully integrated, state-of-the-art smart-locker solutions. As for my role: I've been helping to sustain our accelerated growth pace by designing, discussing, and implementing evolutionary architectural solutions that are scalable, reliable, and expandable, while also going fully hands-on with coding tasks on our several fronts. By the way, we're hiring for both [front](https://bloqit.factorialhr.com/job_posting/software-engineer-frontend-67596) and [backend](https://bloqit.factorialhr.com/job_posting/software-engineer-backend-67370)-focused positions, and also for several other areas in tech.

I've been using GitHub both professionally and as my portfolio. As a result of this fact, the contribution stats shown here are a comprehensive summary of all my engineering efforts on these two fronts. My public repositories approach a wide range of engineering topics, all implemented with clean code that works and solid documentation and references. So make sure to take a look at the Pinned section below!
